                A Full-Stack Web developer who uses previous experience in paramedic-level emergency medicine to bring a detail-oriented,
                critical-thinking mindset to my coding. Recently earned a certificate from the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp, with skills in the MERN stack,
                HTML/CSS, SQL, and OOP.  Known as a problem solver with a knack for JavaScript, my experience coding has ignited a passion for developing concise
                and well documented code with a responsive and aesthetically pleasing UX.  Strong skills in teamwork and communication under challenging conditions
                and deadlines is just some of the skills I bring to a team. I am excited to bring my problem-solving drive to a fast-paced team who provides an intuitive,
                aesthetically pleasing, and UX focused product.
